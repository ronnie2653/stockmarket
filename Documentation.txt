2. Defined the shared resource as syncronized stock and trade collections and data service to access it:
    - SimpleStockDataStorage, SimpleStockDao, SimpleStockDaoImpl 

3. Implementation of the required functionality: TDD, first defined the test and than do the implementation.
    - test: SimpleStockServiceImplTest, SimpleStockServiceImplTradesTest
    - api, impl: SimpleStockService, SimpleStockServiceImpl
